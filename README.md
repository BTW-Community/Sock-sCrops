# Sock'sCrops
Welcome to my Crops Addon for BTW Community Edition

This Addon adds new crops and gives old ones a fresh coat of paint (well kinda totally overhauled them).
I hope to fill the hole of HCSpawning with more things to discover and do. Maybe these crops will also help you survive?
Many things to come. Keep watching this space.

Release coming as soon as the first 4 crops are done ( Grapes, Apple Tree, Pumpkins and Bamboo)!
